[Science Journal for iOS][appstore] allows you to gather data from the world around you. It uses sensors to
measure your environment, like light and sound, so you can graph your data, record your experiments,
and organize your questions and ideas. It's the lab notebook you always have with you.

## Required dependencies
First, you'll need a Mac. We don't support building the iOS app on anything else.

Second, you'll need the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.

Third, we use a few open source frameworks to build this app, so you'll need to install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) as your package manager in order to get what you need to build.

Fourth, we use [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/). You'll need to install that too. We use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install it.

Here are the steps to set up your environment:

1. Install Xcode.
2. Install CocoaPods by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` from your terminal.
3. Install Homebrew by following the instructions on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/).
4. Install protobuf by running `brew install protobuf@3.6; brew link protobuf@3.6 -f` from your terminal.

## Building and running
Before you jump into coding, you'll need to run `pod install` from the root of this project (the folder that contains has the `Podfile` file)

Then you can open `ScienceJournal.xcworkspace`

**Note:** there is a `ScienceJournal.xcodeproj` file, but since we use CocoaPods, you shouldn't use that project file. If you do, nothing will work üò≠
